# Geometric Area Calculator

Calculate areas of geometric figures using ***Python*** with support of ***multithreading*** and ***multiprocessing***.

## Introduction

The Geometric Area Calculator is a Python project designed to efficiently ***compute the areas of various geometric figures.*** Leveraging the power of ***multithreading*** and ***multiprocessing***, this project provides fast and parallelized calculations.

## Features

***Multithreading and Multiprocessing:*** Utilizes both threading and multiprocessing modules for concurrent and parallelized area calculations.

***Randomization:*** Incorporates the random module to generate random geometric parameters for testing and demonstration purposes.

***Timing Functionality:*** Includes time-related functionality from the time module to measure the performance of area calculations.

## Requirements

***Python*** 3.12 ( recommended )

***random***

***threading***

***multiprocessing***
